To the Editor,

Hong Kong faces a growing challenge from chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Early screening and health education are essential to reduce this burden. Government and community collaboration can ensure that prevention efforts reach those most at risk, especially as our population ages.

Recent studies show that early intervention not only improves quality of life but also reduces long-term healthcare costs. By investing in prevention, supporting community clinics, and expanding public education, we can help residents make informed choices and avoid serious complications.

I urge policymakers to expand screening programmes and health campaigns, and to work closely with NGOs and healthcare providers. Together, we can build a healthier future for Hong Kong.
