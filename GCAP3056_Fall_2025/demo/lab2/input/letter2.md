Two suspected domestic worker suicide cases were reported in recent weeks, taking the total number to at least three this year.

Behind these tragedies lies a silent crisis: many domestic workers endure chronic mental distress with little access to support. Each loss leaves the worker’s family grief-stricken and the employer’s household deeply shaken.

Migrant domestic workers make up 9.6 per cent of Hong Kong’s labour force. They have a vital role in caregiving, with 44 per cent of households with working mothers and 11 per cent of elderly singles employing a domestic worker in 2016 and 2023, respectively.

Yet, domestic workers’ mental well-being is a growing concern. A 2020-2021 survey found 31 per cent of domestic workers reporting depression and 18 per cent anxiety. Long working hours, isolation, physical or verbal abuse and prolonged separation from family all contribute to their mental burden.

A review of Coroner’s Court records between 2007 and 2021 identified 114 suicides among migrant domestic workers. Nearly half occurred within their first employment contract. Two issues emerged as key triggers – 33 per cent of cases involved family conflict, while 34 per cent were linked to debt.
