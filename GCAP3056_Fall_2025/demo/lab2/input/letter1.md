Researchers from Hong Kong and the United Kingdom have together developed a new predictive model that can estimate the lifetime risk of diabetic patients having a stroke, cancer and premature death, enabling doctors to provide more personalised treatment.

Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) researchers said the model, the first of its kind tailored to the Chinese population, could eventually make healthcare more sustainable, affordable and accessible by accurately identifying patients’ risks.

Diabetes is a major cause of death in Hong Kong, claiming 570 lives in 2023.

It increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, retinopathy, kidney failure and nerve damage.

One in 10 Hongkongers – about 720,000 people – has diabetes and the figure is expected to grow to 900,000 by 2030, according to the International Diabetes Federation.

Professor Juliana Chan Chung-ngor of CUHK’s Department of Medicine and Therapeutics said it was necessary to build a predictive model derived from local data because those developed elsewhere were not accurate for Hong Kong’s population.

“The epicentre of the diabetes epidemic is in Asia, where patients develop the condition at a younger age, with a lower body mass index, and are more likely to suffer from kidney disease and stroke,” she said.

Over the past 10 years, CUHK collaborated with Oxford University to develop the Chinese Diabetes Outcome Model, using data from the Hong Kong Diabetes Register.

The team used the data of 21,500 type 2 diabetes patients at two public hospitals and one risk assessment centre between 2002 and 2019, in the register.

The model could estimate their lifetime risk of developing 10 complications, including stroke, heart disease, lower limb amputation, end-stage kidney disease, any cancer, and premature death, and predict the subsequent impact on the quality of life and healthcare costs.

Chan said the prediction was dynamic as it would factor in how the onset of one complication affected the chance of developing others.

The model could also predict the potential impact of modifying risk factors, such as blood pressure, blood lipids, blood sugar, body weight and the use of different kinds of medications.

Doctors could, therefore, compare different treatments and pick the most cost-effective personalised plan for the patients.

For example, a 53-year-old man diagnosed with diabetes for 10 years and a history of coronary heart disease was expected to live only 12 more years, preceded by multiple hospital admissions due to complications, if he was obese, smoked, and had poor control of blood lipids, blood pressure, and blood sugar.

However, he could live up to 18 years longer with considerable savings in healthcare costs if he quit smoking, lost weight and had better control of risk factors.

Based on data from the registry, the team also found that the incidence of any major complication was 18 per 100 diabetic patients per year.

Most patients showed an impaired quality of life, with those experiencing cardiovascular issues reporting the biggest decline.

Healthcare costs increased by five to 17-fold after complications occurred, driven by admissions to intensive care units, hospital wards or care homes.

The most expensive complications were lower limb amputation, stroke, and end-stage kidney disease, with the costs ranging from US$14,000 to US$31,000.

However, if patients properly controlled their risk factors, such as losing weight and quitting smoking, they could save HK$5,540 (US$713) each year, on average.

The savings were even higher for those with cardiovascular and kidney issues, and those with early onset of diabetes.

The prediction results were validated against data from more than 176,000 patients at public hospitals and clinics, and the model was found to have satisfactory accuracy in predicting the risk of most complications.

Chan said the model would contribute to a more sustainable healthcare system in the long run by helping the government prioritise and allocate resources more effectively.

“We could use the model to identify patients of different risk levels, providing them with the right treatment, at the right time, at the right place, by the right people, and the outcome should be cost-effective,” she said.

For example, patients with a higher risk of hospitalisation could be identified early, and provided with more intensive but cost-effective treatments.

“Given the heavy burden on the healthcare system, the government could also make use of the model to develop new payment models to make the system more sustainable,” she said.

Chan said the team would work with stakeholders such as the Hospital Authority to explore how the data derived from the model could facilitate their decision-making process.

The findings were published earlier in the international journal Diabetes Care.
