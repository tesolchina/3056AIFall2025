# Chronic Care — Discussion Notes Summary

Source folder: `/workspaces/3056AIFall2025/GCAP3056_Fall_2025/teacherNotes/Chronic-Care/DiscussionNotes`

Files summarized:
- `meeting_notes.md`
- `project_discussions.md`

## Overview
The documents are project-facing notes for the Chronic Care team. They include a link to the working Google Doc where students collaborate and a lightweight template for tracking discussion topics, research findings, challenges, and next steps.

## Key points
- Main working document: a Google Doc (link appears in `meeting_notes.md`) that students are actively using for collaborative edits and planning.
- `project_discussions.md` provides a reusable template to capture:
  - Discussion topic, date, participants
  - Key points and research findings
  - Challenges identified
  - Next steps with action items

## Recommendations / Next steps
- Centralize contributions in the referenced Google Doc and ensure that all teams keep the `project_discussions.md` template updated for each meeting.
- Use the template consistently to make meeting notes machine-parsable later (e.g., consistent headings for automated summary extraction).
- Suggested immediate actions:
  1. Confirm the Google Doc editing permissions so all team members can contribute.
  2. For the next meeting, fill out one `Discussion Topic` entry using the provided template and assign responsible persons for each next step.
  3. Consider exporting completed discussion entries to a single Markdown log (or CSV) periodically for instructor review.

## Suggested structure for future summaries
- Date range covered
- Participants
- Summary of decisions made
- Tasks assigned (owner + due date)
- Follow-up items for instructors

## Short action checklist
- [ ] Ensure Google Doc access is available to all students
- [ ] Ask teams to use `project_discussions.md` template in every meeting
- [ ] Export a snapshot of the Doc before major milestones for grading/review
