Request context: asking for documents, data, and clarifications to inform design and policy recommendations for an Emergency Alert System.

Data and Records

Please provide official incident logs for the past 3 years, including timestamps, geolocation, event type, severity, and which alert channels were used.
Do you maintain an authoritative registry of alerts and dissemination metadata? If so, provide access or export format (schema).
Provide documented results of any system tests or drills conducted in the last 24 months (scope, outcomes, metrics).
Technical / Interoperability
4. What technical specifications exist for current alert systems (APIs, message formats, protocols, authentication)?
5. Are there integration guidelines or middleware in use for connecting local systems to state/federal alerting infrastructure?
6. What standards (if any) are mandated for interoperability (e.g., Common Alerting Protocol)?

Governance & Roles
7. Which agency/office is legally authorized to issue each class of alert (e.g., evacuation, shelter-in-place, health advisory)?
8. Provide organizational charts or documented roles for alert coordination, issuance, and verification.
9. What escalation and approval processes are required before an alert is issued?

Funding & Procurement
10. What budgets, grants, or funding streams are allocated for alerting system upgrades and operations for the next 2–5 years?

15. Provide outreach plans and records of public awareness campaigns on alerting systems.

Performance & Metrics
16. What KPIs or performance metrics are tracked for alerting (delivery time, reach, user feedback)?
17. Are there SLAs or uptime targets for critical alerting components? Provide historical performance if available.

Security & Resilience
18. Describe cybersecurity measures, incident response plans, and redundancy strategies for the alerting infrastructure.
19. Are backup dissemination channels documented? Provide architecture diagrams if available.

Operational Questions
20. Who are the operational points of contact for technical integration and for policy/governance questions? Provide names, roles, and preferred communications channels.
21. What are the typical timelines for approvals and procurement for system changes (estimate in days/weeks)?

Data Access & Sharing
22. Can anonymized historical alert data be made available for analysis? If so, specify format, delivery mechanism, and any access restrictions.
23. Are there public or internal dashboards/reports we can access for ongoing monitoring?

Supporting Documents
24. Please provide any strategic plans, after-action reports, or evaluations related to emergency communications from the last 5 years.
