Overview

Brief statement of project intent and scope (fill in): what types of emergencies, geography, populations of concern, timeframe.
Key Issues and Evidence Gaps

Data completeness and timeliness
Missing or outdated incident logs and alert timestamps.
Lack of standardized data fields across sources (e.g., location precision, event severity).
Geographic and demographic coverage
Limited reporting in rural or underserved communities.
Insufficient demographic breakdowns (age, disability, language).
Interoperability and technical integration
Unclear compatibility between existing alert systems and proposed solution.
Gaps in APIs, data formats, and standards for exchanging alerts.
Roles, responsibilities, and governance
Ambiguity about which agencies own alert issuance vs. coordination vs. local implementation.
No clear escalation or handoff procedures documented.
Funding, procurement, and sustainability
Unclear budget commitments or procurement pathways for system upgrades.
Questions about ongoing maintenance and staffing.
Privacy, legal, and policy constraints
Data-sharing restrictions and privacy safeguards not consistently documented.
Legal authority to issue certain types of alerts is unclear or fragmented.
Public communication and accessibility
Gaps in multi-language messaging and accessible formats for people with disabilities.
Limited public awareness/testing of current alert channels.
Testing, evaluation, and performance metrics
Few documented test results, performance benchmarks, or reliability metrics.
Lack of metrics for measuring reach, timeliness, and effectiveness.
Security and resilience
Limited public info on cybersecurity measures and redundancy/recovery plans.
Evidence quality and source credibility
Variation in reliability across media reports, community notes, and agency releases.
Need to validate key claims with primary data or official records.
Prioritized Information Needs

Official incident logs with timestamps and geolocation.
Agency contact points and governance documents.
Technical specs for existing systems (APIs, protocols, message formats).
Budget/procurement plans and contractual constraints.
Accessibility and outreach plans for vulnerable populations.
Records of tests, drills, and performance evaluations.
Suggested Next Steps

Compile a prioritized list of documents to request from government (see questions_for_government.md).
Validate high-impact claims with primary data sources.
Map stakeholders and current technical systems to identify integration points.
