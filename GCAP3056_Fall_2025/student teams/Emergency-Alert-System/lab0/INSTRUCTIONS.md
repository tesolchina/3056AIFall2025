# Lab 0: File Processing with AI Agents

## Input

**Input Folder:** /workspaces/3056AIFall2025/GCAP3056_Fall_2025/teacherNotes/Emergency-Alert-System/DiscussionNotes
- Example: `../DiscussionNotes/`
- Or: `../../teacherNotes/Emergency-Alert-System/DiscussionNotes/`

### Input Requirements
- [Describe what types of files you want to process]
- [Specify file formats (e.g., .md, .txt, .csv)]
- [Note any specific files or patterns to include/exclude]

## Process

### Task Options (Choose one or more to explore):

#### Option 1: Content Summarization
Ask the AI agent to read through all files in the input folder and generate a comprehensive summary in markdown format.

#### Option 2: Data Extraction
Extract specific information (dates, names, key decisions) from the input files and organize them in a structured format.

#### Option 3: Analysis and Insights
Analyze the content to identify themes, patterns, or key takeaways and present them in a report.

#### Option 4: File Organization
Reorganize or categorize files based on their content or metadata.

#### Option 5: Custom Task
[Define your own processing task - be creative!]

### Instructions for AI Agent:
1. [Specify step-by-step instructions for the AI]
2. [Include any specific requirements or constraints]
3. [Describe the expected workflow]

## Output

**Output Folder:** `/workspaces/3056AIFall2025/GCAP3056_Fall_2025/student teams/Emergency-Alert-System/lab0/output`

### Output Requirements
- [Describe what output files should be created]
- [Specify the format (e.g., .md, .json, .csv)]
- [Include any naming conventions]

### Expected Output Format
[Describe the structure and content of the expected output]

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will learn:
- How to instruct AI agents to work with specific files and folders
- How to specify input and output locations clearly
- How to design tasks for AI-assisted file processing
- How to explore different use cases for AI-powered document processing

## Exploration Challenge

Try different approaches:
1. **Simple task:** Start with a basic summarization task
2. **Complex task:** Try extracting structured data and creating multiple output files
3. **Custom task:** Design a task specific to your team's project needs

Document your findings and what works best for your team's workflow!
